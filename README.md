# Optimizing Matrix Multiplication 

This project is an implementation of the forward pass of a CNN kernel. Within the kernel/matrix_ops.c file, there are several optimizations of the original matrix multiplication function. These include blocking, sparse matrix multiplication (with CSR format), and multithreading.
